# Kylin API

This API is set up for use with Python >= 3.7 and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). You can set-up your local environment manually or compose up with docker to launch a containerised version of the API.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kylin-Network/kylin-api.git
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server with Docker, you'll need to [install Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) if you havent already. Then, you can run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start two Docker containers:
- kylin-api: [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) server that wraps the Flask app defined in `api/app.py`
- postgres: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database

You should now be able to send:

```bash
curl localhost:8080/health
```

And receive the response `OK` and status code `200`. You can see other example calls, [here](#example-calls). 

Your server and database are running in a detached state as indicated by `-d`. When you are ready to bring down your server, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Running locally

To run the server locally, you'll need to install a few requirements. To do this, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements/common.txt
``` 

If you are running a local PostgreSQL instance, create an 'SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI' environment variable:
```bash
export SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="YOUR CONNECTION STRING"
```
If you plan on writing to the database, you'll need to create a `parachain_data` table as defined in `schemas.sql`.

Finally, to boot up the server, run:

```bash
bash bin/run.sh
``` 

You should now be able to interact with your server as described above.

## Example Calls
Get price feed:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/prices?currency_pairs=btc_usd"
```

Write to database:
```bash
curl -d '{"data": "This is json serializable data", "feed": "demo_feed", "block": "1", "hash": "demo_hash"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/submit
```
Query database:
```bash
# select all data
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/query/all

# select by hash
curl "http://localhost:8080/query?hash=demo_hash"

# select by feed
curl "http://localhost:8080/query?feed=demo_feed"
```

## Testing the API

Testing the API is set up using `pytest`. To execute tests you can install the project's development dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements/develop.txt
```
Then from the root directory, run:
```bash
pytest
```
This runs `tests/test_api.py` which contains test functions.

## Accessing the Swagger 
With the application running, use the browser to search the following:
```bash
http://localhost:8080/
```

You can see the API's specification and try it directly from the swagger UI.  

Inside the `default namespace` you will see the list of the endpoints available. You can test them using the `try_out` button.
